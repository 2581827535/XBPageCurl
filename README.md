# XBPageCurl

XBPageCurl is a free and open-source implementation of a page curl animation/transition for views in iOS that intends to mimic the behavior of the pages in apps like iBooks and GoogleMaps for iOS.

It uses OpenGL ES 2 to draw a deformed mesh of triangles. Conceptually, it projects the vertices of the mesh on a virtual cylinder that touches the view. You can move, rotate and change the radius of the cylinder, with or without animation. This will make the mesh curl around the cylinder. The mesh deformation is performed in a vertex shader which makes it really fast.

Lots of improvements yet to come.
